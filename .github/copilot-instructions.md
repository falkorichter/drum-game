Always update and validate the README

write comprehensive tests

verify no external code conflicts

document AI/LLM tools used in the development process

bump version in manifest with each commit that does not touch markdown files

try to separate tests in separate files so multiple pull requests don't conflict

Update the Development Metadata in README with every PR

Please update the README or main contribution guide to reflect this new instruction so that all documentation stays in sync.

Use Semantic Versioning https://semver.org/ 
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

When adding new localization keys to the extension, ensure they are translated to all supported languages (de, es, fr, ja, pt, zh_CN) not just en_US. All locale files must contain proper translations for new keys to maintain internationalization support.

Maintain CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog v1.1.0 format (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). When making changes:
- Add entries to the [Unreleased] section using proper categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, Deprecated
- Use semantic versioning for releases (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Include date in YYYY-MM-DD format for releases
- Add GitHub comparison links for versions
- Use `npm run changelog:generate` script to help create entries from git history when appropriate
- Keep entries concise but descriptive enough for users to understand the impact

localize the frontend, add a language selector in settings if present

don't disable buttons without showing a hint when people click on and it to know why it is disabled

log all errors to the console so I can see what's going on if neccesary

add screenshots to pull request whenever possible
